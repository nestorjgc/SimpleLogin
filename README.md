# SimpleLogin
<h2>Login is successful only with administrator credentials.</h2>
<p>This program is a login system for the administrator only. (While loop used, strings, if,else) This is a work in progress that I have. <br>The goals for this project are to apply this code to one of my future projects. Ask user for username If "nestor" and "garcia123" are true, then "Succcessful Login".
